#to do
- IMP calculate time etc in a separate human readable report file (log caveats like anything even remotely lesser than ten minutes 
	won't be logged, usable history even after images deleted)
- - format draft: tally each time, complete one for each hour and sum it up for the day    
- - record the units lost
- deprecate Awareness's role completely
- - Sessions only count tally when off, try to mimic Awareness and log that
- - one remaining challenge is to detect inactivity too: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/206942/detect-mouse-move-or-keystroke
- - thought experiment: shouldn't have to worry about logging it manually much, only once work time over at break and with ease interpret the report
- - showing timer another challenge
- if var exists -z versus -n
- decrease number of text files
