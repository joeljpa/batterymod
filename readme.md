## Batterymod - a simple bash script which logs your activity periodically on OS X

#### Introduction
Batterymod works by checking the whether the screen is on via OS X's pmset command. To use it, it must be scheduled to run by cron every minute. By default, every ten minutes a screenshot is taken capturing your work - provided the screen was on throughout that time.
