#bugs

#to do
- options, disable specific feature without quitting (see 2 above)
- IMP calculate time etc in a separate human readable report file (log caveats like anything even remotely lesser than ten minutes 
	won't be logged, usable history even after images deleted)
- - format draft: tally each time, complete one for each hour and sum it up for the day    
- deprecate Awareness's role completely in addition to having more control and options with it; the mouse being idle and resetted needs to be done somehow
- - Sessions only count tally when off, try to mimic Awareness and log that
- - one remaining challenge is to detect inactivity too: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/206942/detect-mouse-move-or-keystroke
- - thought experiment: shouldn't have to worry about logging it manually much, only once work time over at break and with ease interpret the report
- if var exists -z versus -n
- decrease number of text files
